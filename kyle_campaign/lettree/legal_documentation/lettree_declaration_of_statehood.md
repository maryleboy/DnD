# The Lettree Declaration of Statehood
We the members of the faction of Lettree, empowered by the signed consent of King Athur, hereby declare the establishment of the nation of Lettree as a Constitutional Parlimentary Monarchy governed by law derived from the constitution herein.

# The Constitution of Lettree

## Article 1 - The System of Law
### Section 1 - The Lettree Legal Precedent
The Lettree Legal Precedent is a document containing a comprehensive list of the enforcable laws that govern Lettree and the method in which they are to be enforced.
### Section 2 - Ratification of the Precedent
Ratification is the method by which a law enters the Lettree Legal Precedent and thus becomes enforcable. After a law has been ratified, if it is broken this constitutes a crime.
### Section 3 - Striking of the Precedent
Striking is the method by which a law is removed from the Lettree Legal Precedent. After a law is struck, if it is broken this does not constitute a crime.
### Section 4 - The Conditions of Enforcement
The methods of enforcement for different laws are detailed alongside the laws in the Lettree Legal Precedent. Enforcement occurs only if a law is broken whilst the Lettree Legal Precedent documents it. This means that laws ratified after they are broken are not to be enforced. In the same way, if a law is broken and is struck from the lettree legal precedent after the crime has already occured, enforcement is still warrented as the law was broken whilst it was Precedent.
### Section 5 - Criminal Courts
The method of enforcement for most laws involve a "call for detainment and trial" and a "justice recommendation".

If a law indicates a "call for detainment and trial", this means that if someone is suspected of breaking this law, the Lettree Department of Justice is obligated to detain that person and conduct a fair trial to determine if the law has been broken and to what extent it has been broken to.

If a fair trial has determined that a law has been broken an appointed Judge is to determine a punishment based on the extent to which the law has been broken and the "justice recommendation". the "justice recommendation" is supposed to indicate the punishment given for a typical occurrance and is not definitive.

For example: if the "justice recommendation" for theft is "2 years imprisonment" then this is what a judge ought to give in a typical case. An atypical "lesser evil" case like a poor man stealing bread to feed their family may lead to a lesser sentence like 6 months imprisonment. Likewise an atypical "greater evil" case  like a career criminal stealing money from an orphanage may lead to a greater sentence like 6 years imprisonment and a fine exceeding the value stolen to be paid in full to the orphanage.

It is ultimately the responsibilty of the judge to make the descision of what crime fits what punishment.
### Section 6 - Extrajudicial Enforcent
It is possible for a law in the Lettree Legal Precedent to invode extrajudicial methods of enforcement. Extrajudicial methods of enforcement are methods that do not involve a "call for detainment and trial".

For example: an ongoing act of terror could be enforced by firing at the assailant to prevent them from continuing rather than attempting to detain them and try them in court as in this case detainment may endanger officers and civilians.
### Section 7 - Pardonment
If someone is determined by a fair court to be guilty of breaking the law, any punishment given to them can removed via an official pardon. 
### Section 8 -  Royal Arrest
Even if someone is not suspected of breaking the law, a royal arrest can still be used to detain them. If a Royal Arrest has been called on someone, this supercedes the Lettree Legal Precedent and can be used to order the Lettree Department of Justice to detain them. A Royal Arrest is not a conviction and this detention only lasts 5 days after which another Royal Arrest is required to detain this person for another 5 days.

Although a conviction from a judge is needed to punish any detained person, a Royal Arrest gives special powers to the Lettree Department of Justice to use torture as a method of interrogation.

## Article 2 - The Powers and Responsibilties of the Monarch
### Section 1 - Ratifying Law
The most authoritive word in Lettree is to come from the Monarch and thus any law passed by any legislative body must be ratified by the Monarch in order to enter Lettree Legal Precedent (see Article 1 Section 2).
### Section 2 - Removing Law
Any existing ratified law can be struck from Lettree legal precedent by the Monarch at any time for any reason the Monarch sees fit (see Article 1 Section 3).
### Section 3 - Establishing Royal Institutions
The Monarch can establish institutions to serve Lettree and to provide services. This includes but is not limited to:
- The defense of the realm
- The establishment of courts

It is important to note that as the Monarch has no power to allocate the budget and rescources of Lettree, in order to fund and supply any Royal Institution the Monarch must rely on Parliment to do so with public funds and rescources or the Monarch must supply these institutions out of their own pocket.
### Section 4 - The Commander-in-Chief
Any military organisation established in Lettree is to be subject to the direct command of the Monarch. Thus any chain of command establish is to include the Monarch as holding the highest rank shared by no peers.
### Section 5 - Appointing and Expelling of Judges
The Monarch holds the ability to appoint anyone to be a judge whenever they wish. The Monarch can do this to any court in lettree (see Article 1 Section 5).

The Monarch also holds the power to remove any existing judge whenever they wish. The Monarch can do this to any court in lettree.
### Section 6 - Limited Ability to Supercede the System of Law
The Monarch has the abilty to make pardons and royal arrests on anyone including members of government whenever they please (see Article 1 Sections 7-8).
### Section 7 - The Head of State
In all interactions with entities outside of Lettree, the Monarch is to take the official role of Head of State. This means that the Monarch has the power act as the representative of all of Lettree and thus sign any treaty or alliance on behalf of all citizens. The Monarch can give any induvidual the ability act as Acting Head of State whenever the Monarch wishes, for any length of time the Monarch wishes and under any condition.

For example: if the Monarch finds themselves unable to attend an alliance meeting, where allied states are voting on an alliance policy, the Monarch can send someone to vote on behalf of Lettree during that meeting.
### Section 8 - Nominating New Members of Parliment
The Monarch is the only person in Lettree who can nominate new Parlimentary Nominees and can do so without limit whenever they please.

The Monarch can nominate any citizen of Lettree with the exeception of the Monarch themselves.
### Section 9 - Striking Members from Parliment
The Monarch is the only person in Lettree who can remove Members of Parliment and can do so without limit whenever they please. This means that the Monarch can remove all members of Parliment, so that all seats are vacant.
### Section 10 - Modifying the Dimensions of Parliment
The Monarch can change the number of seats in Parliment to any number whenever they wish with a minimum limit of 3 seats.

## Article 3 - The Structure of Parliment
### Section 1 - Members of Parliment
Parliment is formed of a series of Members of Parliment who decide on legistation.
### Section 2 - Seats
Parliment is made up of a number of seats determined by the Monarch (see Article 2 Section 10). Each seat represents a position in parliment that a member of parliment can hold.
### Section 3 - Vacancies
Vacancies occur when a seat is not held by any member of Parliment. This can happen if a Member of Parliment resigns, dies, or is struck from Parliment (see Article 2 Section 9). The only other way for this to occur is if the Monarch increases the number of seats in Parliment (see Article 2 Section 10).

If a seat is vacant, before any other legislative action is to be performed, Parliment must vote on a new Member of Parliment to fill the vacant seat. Parliment can only vote for Parlimentry Nominees and the Monarch is the only person who can put forward new Parlimentry Nominees (see Article 2 Section 8). 

Parliment can wait for as long as they wish to cast this vote if they do not like any of the Nominees chosen by the King, however until they fill all seats they cannot perform any other legislative action.

If Parliment is ever completely vacant. Only then does the Monarch gain the Power to Elect 3 members as no parliment would exist to stop this. Theoretically by Article 2 Section 9 the Monarch could use their power to wipe Parliment clean and force in their own Members of Parliment but this action would be so drastic such an event is believed to be unlikely
### Section 4 - Overcrowded Parliment
If there are ever more Members of Parliment than there are seats, the Monarch must use their powers to strike members from Parliment (see Article 2 Section 9) to reduce the number of members until all memebers have a seat.

As the only way for there to be more members than seats if for the Monarch used their power to reduce the number of seats in Parliment (see Article 2 Section 10), it is expected that if the Monarch reduces the number of seats in Parliment they will also reduce the number of members.

## Article 4 - The Powers and Responsibilities of Parliment
### Section 1 - Execution of Powers
All powers that Parliment holds are to be executed when a majority of Members of Parliment vote to execute them. This is different to the Monarch as the Monarch has no such caveat and can execute their powers at will.
### Section 2 - Creating New Laws
Parliment is the only legislative body that holds the ability to create new laws.

Laws created by Parliment do not enter the Lettree Legal Precedent until they are ratified by the Monarch  (see Article 2 Section 1), so while Parliment can create new laws, they cannot put these laws into effect without the consent of the Monarch.

However, as only Parliment can create new laws, if the Monarch wants a new law, they must ask Parliment to create it.
### Section 3 - Ammending the Constitution
Parliment is the only legislative body with the ability to make ammendments to the Constitution. To do so they must gain Royal Consent from the Monarch and a majority in a public referendum alongside the standard majority from parliment to execute powers.
### Section 4 - Establishing Government Institutions
Parliment can establish instituions to serve Lettree and to provide services. This includes but is not limited to:
- The enforcement of the law
- The regulation of business
- The provision of government services, for example:
    - The postal service
    - Transportation
### Section 5 - Allocating Resources
Parliment holds the final say on how the budget and resources of Lettree is to be allocated. This does not require Royal Consent from the Monarch.

It is important to note that this extends only to public funds and public resources. Parliment holds no right to seize goods or currency from citizens outside of the system of taxation.
### Section 6 - Taxation
Parliment holds the right to decide how the citizens of Lettree are to be taxed. This does not require Royal Consent from the Monarch.

It is important to note that the Monarch aids Lettree in rule and servitude and thus no taxation of goods or currency from the Monarch is warranted.
